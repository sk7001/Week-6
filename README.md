## Overview
This week was dedicated to learning the essentials of Java backend development. We explored how to set up and use Tomcat Servlets, gained a foundational understanding of the Spring Framework, developed RESTful APIs, implemented multi-layered architectures, and built a functional Employee Payroll application with a service layer and H2 in-memory database.

- Handling HTTP requests and responses
- Implementing CRUD operations

### Day 4: Spring Framework and Multi-Layer Development with H2 DB
- Understanding multi-layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository)
- Integrating H2 in-memory database
- Data persistence and JPA

### Day 5: Spring Employee Payroll App with Service Layer
- Developing a payroll management system
- Service layer logic and business rules
- End-to-end testing of backend functionality
